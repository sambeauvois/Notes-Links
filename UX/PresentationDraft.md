# What is UX

First things first : UX !== UI !

UI is part of UX, as Usability  and other stuff are

## A few distinctions:

### The UI
 +The User interface is the way the user inteacts with an product.+
 
- It can be a console prompt
- It can be a graphical user interface (GUI) : desktop, web, mobile
- It can be a couple of sensors, cameras, ... --> NUI : Natural User Interface
- It's the wheel, the gear, the buttons on your car
- It's the light switch in your living room

The UI is the way a person interact with a product, and the product is not always an app.

### The usability

- It's the fact that an user is able to use a product
- 

Sometimes the UI is beautiful, but not really usable

### The interaction design

### The small details that makes the difference

# UX Design

[https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/09/16/what-is-ux-design-15-user-experience-experts-weigh-in/]

What is UX Design ? - Well, I think it’s important to start by saying there’s no commonly accepted definition.

' The goal of UX design in business is to “improve customer satisfaction and loyalty through the utility, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction with a product.

# UI concepts

## Design patterns
---- not the "gang of four" kind

Don't try to re-invent the way the user interact with an application. Keep the user in his comfort zone

Examples:

Website :
- logo top left == home page
- 

A basic control should behave as expected. 

The reaction to an action should be visible 

## Icons

Most of the icons we are used to see are coming from an initial set from Susan Kare (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare http://kare.com/about/ https://www.fastcodesign.com/1665639/meet-susan-kare-the-pioneer-who-created-the-macs-original-icons)

### Actions

Pick your works carrefully.

For a button: always use a meaningful label.

## Controls

### Navigation

Hyperlinks should look like hyperlinks

Title on links https://www.nngroup.com/articles/title-attribute/




### Inputs - forms

#### label and inputs

Always use a label
Label on top (-- https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-forms-96fadca0f49c)
(example with placeholders https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/)

Always use the 'for' attribute

#### Dropdownlist or radio-buttons?

#### Forms
Forms should be one column but "it depends"
User reading/writing flow
'tab' order

#### Errors

Specify errors inline

#### optional vs required fields
