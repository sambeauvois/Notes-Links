# What is UX

First things first : UX !== UI !

UI is part of UX, as Usability  and other stuff are

## A few distinctions:

### The UI
 +The User interface is the way the user inteacts with an product.+
 
- It can be a console prompt
- It can be a graphical user interface (GUI) : desktop, web, mobile
- It can be a couple of sensors, cameras, ... --> NUI : Natural User Interface
- It's the wheel, the gear, the buttons on your car
- It's the light switch in your living room

The UI is the way a person interact with a product, and the product is not always an app.

### The usability

- It's the fact that an user is able to use a product
- 

Sometimes the UI is beautiful, but not really usable

### The interaction design

### The small details that makes the difference

What is UX Design ? - Well, I think it’s important to start by saying there’s no commonly accepted definition.

' The goal of UX design in business is to “improve customer satisfaction and loyalty through the utility, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction with a product.

# UI concepts

## Design patterns
---- not the "gang of four" kind

Don't try to re-invent the way the user interact with an application. Keep the user in his comfort zone

Examples:

Website :
- logo top left == home page
- 


## Icons

Most of the icons we are used to see are coming from an initial set from Susan Kare (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare http://kare.com/about/ https://www.fastcodesign.com/1665639/meet-susan-kare-the-pioneer-who-created-the-macs-original-icons)

For a button: always use a meaningful label.

## Controls

### label and inputs

Always use a label

(example with textplaceholders)

Always use the 'for' attribute
