# What is UX

First things first : UX !== UI !

UI is part of UX, as Usability  and other stuff are

## A few distinctions:

_ UI: The User interface is the way the user inteacts with an product._
- It can be a console prompt
- It can be a graphical user interface (GUI) : desktop, web, mobile
- It can be a couple of sensors, cameras, ... --> NUI : Natural User Interface
- It's the wheel, the gear, the buttons on your car
- IT's the light switch in your living room

The UI is the way a person interact with a product, and the product is not always an app.
